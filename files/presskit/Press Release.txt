# Bycatch a newly released card game about drones and surveillance

Berlin, May 15th 2015 (for immediate release)

[Bycatch](http://%20http//bycat.ch/) is a casual card game about the topics of remote warfare and drone surveillance due to be released at [TWO5SIX](http://2015.two5six.com/) on May 16th, 2015.

Bycatch is a simple to learn and quick to play game aimed at a broad audience. Bycatch treats surveillance by employing mobile phone cameras as surveillance drones during the game (pictured below). Bycatch contains illustrations in an evocative art style drawn by Dutch illustrator [Agnes Loonstra](http://www.agnesloonstra.nl/) to create empathy with the citizens and horrors of done strikes. The aim of Bycatch is to let people play with and think about the issues in contemporary warfare.

Bycatch can be played by three to five players and uses well-known card game mechanics. Players have a hand of cards with a number value and a drawing of a person on each card. A current suspect card determines who is currently a suspect. Players can either make sets of their own cards and put those in a shelter or they can drone strike another player. A drone strike removes three adjacent cards from somebody's hand with each suspect netting 100 points while collateral damage is counted as minus 10 points. The game continues until there are no more suspects.

Bycatch is the first popular card game to tackle drone warfare and the first physical game that uses mobile phone cameras as surveillance devices. Unlike other tabletop games that employ mobile devices, playing Bycatch does not require downloading a custom app.

Bycatch will be launched at [TWO5SIX](http://2015.two5six.com/) on May 16th, 2015 in Brooklyn and will then be officially available for purchase via the [Bycat.ch](http://bycat.ch/) website for the price of  €12 (excluding shipping and taxes). TWO5SIX is the avant-garde games and culture festival organized by [Killscreen](http://killscreendaily.com/).

Bycatch has been designed in an unique collaboration between design studio [Hubbub](http://hubbub.eu/) and [Subalekha Udayasankar](http://about.me/subalekha). The game has been produced over the course of a year and tested with people from a wide variety of backgrounds.

Subalekha Udayasankar, an Indian/American designer motivated the design of Bycatch as: “I was fascinated by these two findings. 1. Drones are not perfect, they rely on perfect weather conditions and operator dexterity and most military decisions are made based on these imperfect surveillance machines 2. How can one empathize with someone living under Drones on the other side of the planet if their personal space has never been violated? Bycatch is a space for players to experience and confront these otherwise hard subject areas through play and storytelling.”

Hans de Zwart, chair of Dutch digital rights association [Bits of Freedom](http://bof.nl/) said that: “The paradox of Bycatch is that it makes you think critically about collateral damage and the arbitrariness of surveillance while at the same time being a very entertaining game to play.”
